# ðŸ¤‘ How To Buy $RAFL

$RAFL is on the Base Blockchain, meaning you will need an EVM-compatible wallet such as [Rabby](https://rabby.io/rabby-points?code=RAFL), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/download). If you do not have an EVM wallet, we suggest using [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/rabby-points?code=RAFL). Everyone earns Rabby Points, and you can use our referral code 'RAFL' for an extra bonus!
