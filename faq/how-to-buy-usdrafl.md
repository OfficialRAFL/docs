# How to Buy $RAFL

$RAFL is on the Base Blockchain, meaning you will need an EVM-compatible wallet such as [Rabby](https://rabby.io/rabby-points?code=RAFL), MetaMask or Trust. If you do not have an EVM wallet, we suggest using [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/rabby-points?code=RAFL). Everyone earns Rabby Points, and you can use our referral code 'RAFL' for an extra bonus!
