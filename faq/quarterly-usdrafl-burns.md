# ðŸ”¥ Quarterly $RAFL Burns

As part of our ongoing commitment to the $RAFL community and in our bid to ensure we are always striving towards a strong price floor to the best of our ability, once per quarter there will be a $RAFL token burn.

The first Monday of every quarter, the [Revenue Sharing Vault](revenue-sharing-vault.md) wallet, will pay out the Revenue Share distributions as it would regularly. Once the distribution is complete, ALL remaining tokens in the Revenue Sharing Vault will be burned. The RAFL Marketing Wallet will be forgoing its portion this week as well to maximize the burn potential.
